# pillow_example_node_pack

Node pack with example nodes using Pillow

This node pack is meant to be used within the [Nodezator](https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator) app. It is just a small node pack with some example nodes using the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library. These are the same nodes used in the [video](https://youtu.be/GlQJvuU7Z_8?t=99) presenting the Nodezator app.

Don't forget to install Pillow in the Python implementation you use to run nodezator, so that the nodes can be loaded without a problem.

Sample files can be downloaded in the following links:

- a sample .ndz file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1od4oeFDhM8NIXIuQOfcIAZyVEbP6yfdk/view?usp=share_link);
- the strawberry basket image to use in the sample file can be found in its [original location](https://pixabay.com/photos/strawberries-fruit-meal-red-berry-4255928/) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YT7lGy1cmimXcIb_f8iAh97OCPt3LWpi/view?usp=share_link);

When opening the file for the first time the app will ask for the location of the node pack in your system in order to load the nodes.
