# pillow_example_node_pack
Node pack with example nodes using Pillow

Just a small node pack with some example nodes using the [Pillow][] library. These are the same nodes used in the [video] presenting the Nodezator app.

Don't forget to install Pillow in the Python implementation you use to run nodezator, so that the nodes can be loaded without a problem.
